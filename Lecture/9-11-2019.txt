O-notation

100n + 5 => is this bound to O(n^2)
100n + 5 <= 100n + n (true for all n >= 5) = 101n <= 101n^2
    c = 101
    n0 = 5

OR

100n + 5 <= 100n + 5n (true for all n greater than or equal to 1) = 105n <= 105n^2
    c = 105
    n0 = 1

OR

100n + 5 <= 1n^2 (true for all n greater than or equal to 101)
    c = 1
    n0 = 101
As c increases, n0 decreases. All of these answers are correct. In this course, we try to minimize the value of c.

Find an upper bound for f(n) = 3n + 8
    O(n)
3n + 8 <= 4n (holds for all n >= 8)
    c = 4
    n0 = 8

OR

3n + 8 <= 3n + 8n
3n + 8 <= 11n (holds true for all n >= 1)
8 <= 8n
    c = 11
    n0 = 1

Find an upperbound for f(n) = n^2 + 1
    O(n^2)
n^2 + 1 <= 2n^2 (holds true for all n >= 1)
    c = 2
    n0 = 1

Omega notation
is n^3 part of the set omega(n^2)? yes

cn^2 <= n^3
    c = 1
    n0 = 1

Find a lower bound for f(n) = 5n^2

omega(n^2) <= 5n^2
5n^2 <= 5n^2
    c = 5
    n0 = 1

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Does f(n) = 100n + 5 (is it a member) of omega(n^2)? no
    there exists positive constants c and n0 such that 0 <= cn^2 <= 100n + 5
